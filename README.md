## Class Log

### Fri 05 Feb 2021

- We discussed the paper [Rooij and Baggio 2021](readings/RooijBaggio2021.pdf) 
- We finished the handout on [rewrite grammars](handouts/rewrite-grammars.pdf)
- For Monday:
  - Read Chapter 1 of [Graf's book](graf-book/999_CompleteLectureNotes.pdf). 
  There is a lot in there but focus on the themes of 'computation', the competence/performance distinction, and Marr's levels. 
  The discussion of Turing machines, sorting algorithms and memory addresses are informative, but strictly speaking not necessary for the larger conceptual points.


### Wed 03 Feb 2021

- Today we introduced the course and went over the syllabus.
- We got through the first few pages on [rewrite grammars](handouts/rewrite-grammars.pdf)
- For Friday:
  - Read [Rooij and Baggio 2021](readings/RooijBaggio2021.pdf) 
  - Think about what languages G2 and G3 generate/recognize/accept.
