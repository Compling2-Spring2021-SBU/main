## Class Log

### Wed May 05 2021

- Today we began discussing how logic can be used to express transformations.
- To learn more read these [draft chapters](readings/dcp1-3.pdf).

### Mon May 03 2021
- Today we discussed weighted logic which debunks the trope that logic only deals with truth and falsity.
- Here is a [handout](handouts/logic-handout-2.pdf) defining the syntax and semantics of weighted MSO logic.
- We also went through the slides if class 3. Note on slide 21, there was an error: it should be univeral quantification in the example, not existential quantification.
- For more on weighted logic, this [chapter](readings/DrosteGastin2009-ch05.pdf) by Droste and Gastin is a good starting point. 
- For more on semirings, see the book ```Jonathan Golan. 1999. Semirings and their Applications. Kluwer Academic Publishers,
Dordrecht.```



### Wed Apr 28 2021
- Today we begin the unit on model theory and logic.
- Here is [handout](handouts/logic-handout-1.pdf) defining the syntax and semantics of MSO and FO logical languages.
- We are going to use slides from [class 2](handouts/lsa2019-class2.pdf), [class 3](lsa2019-class3.pdf), and [class 4](lsa2019-class4.pdf) from the course I gave at the LSA Summer Institute in 2019.

- We finished the slides on subregular complexity.

### Wed Apr 21 2021
- I gave a practice talk ["Making Copies"](http://jeffreyheinz.net/talks/Heinz-2021-MC-slides.pdf) for my MIT linguistics colloquium talk later this afternoon.
- You may also be interested in slides from the minicourse I gave there titled ["Learning Constraints over Representations of Your Own Choosing"](http://jeffreyheinz.net/talks/Heinz-2021-minicourse-LCORYOC-slides.pdf).

- For more on whether the UR/SR mapping in phonology is deterministic or not see [Heinz and Lai 2013](http://jeffreyheinz.net/papers/Heinz-Lai-2013-VHS.pdf), [Jardine 2016](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/phonology/article/computationally-tone-is-different/B01C656A2B96316F3ADCC836BD2A6244), and [McCollum et al 2020](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/phonology/article/unbounded-circumambient-patterns-in-segmental-phonology/AF0AD25DD9EC20420217ED5D2B2A324B).

### Mon Mar 22 2021
- We explained why deterministic TD tree acceptors can't recognize everything deterministuc BU tree acceptors can.

### Fri 19 Mar 2021

- We reviwed top-down tree DFA. 
- Dakotah shared his [proposal for visualizing bottom-up tree acceptors](readings/visualizing-tree-acceptors.pdf). Here is [his question about it](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/4067831)  on the math stackexchange.

- We reviewed 'map' functions on strings
- We defined trees as recursive data structures.

### Fri 26 Feb 2021

- We reviewed where we are in the class and where where we are going.
- We defined strings with a recursive data structure and learned how to define functions which take this data sructure as an input.

### Wed 24 Feb 2021

- We studied Suffix Substitution Closure for Strictly k-local languages. 
- 

### Mon 22 Feb 2021

- We studied the Figure 4.2 on page 64 of Graf's notes and came to understand it.
- For a succinct review on SL_k, read up to section 2.2 pages 329-334 in [Rogers and Pullum 2011](readings/Rogers-Pullum-2011.pdf)

### Fri 19 Feb 2021

- We generalized bigram grammars and languages to k-grams (strictly k-local grammars and languages)
- We studied two ways of dealing with short strings (augmenting with strings with multiple boundaries or extracting factors shorter than k when necessary).
- We saw how for all k, strictly k+1 languages are a proper superset of strictly k languages.

### Wed 17 Feb 2021

- We thought about bigram grammars as "tiling" (see this (whiteboard)[https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_laeryaM=/])
- We showed how CFGs can be thought of as the tiling of 2-local trees (where '2' refers to tree depth). 
- We continued to study Suffix Substitution Closure for bigram languages.
- Optional only: (Ji and Heinz 2020)[http://jeffreyheinz.net/papers/Ji-Heinz-2020-ISLTT.pdf] on ISL tree transducers (which also provides definitions of trees and SL2 tree languages). 

### Mon 15 Feb 2021

- We went over what is expected for [HW1](https://github.com/Compling2-Spring2021-SBU/HW1). It is due next Monday Feb 22.
- We studied Suffix Substitution Closure for bigram languages.

### Fri 12 Feb 2021

- We discussed bigram grammars and languages.
- We talked about mathematical notation w.r.t precision and redundancy.
- For Monday, read Unit 4 up to section 2.3 (up to page 64) in [Graf's book](graf-book/999_CompleteLectureNotes.pdf)
- We will talk about SL2 Substitution Closure on Monday.
- Optional Resources: 
  - I added [Jim Rogers' notes on SL](handouts/slocal.ho.pdf)  to the handouts readings.
  - Jim and I also presented a lot of this at ESSLLI in 2014 in minicourse. Here are the [course's slides](http://jeffreyheinz.net/talks/Rogers-Heinz-2014-MTP-ESSLI-slides.pdf)

### Wed 10 Feb 2021

- We discussed the Stabler paper and emphasized the following:
  - Trees are important for syntax and are motivated by different kinds of observations
  - Stabler's position that "Given the importance of tree languages in linguistic theory, they deserve more attention than they receive."
  - Stabler's 3rd summary point: "In some mildly context-sensitive formalizations of recent syntax, the set of derivations is a regular tree language, and the effect of movement is a regular transduction. This reveals that human languages can be defined in two finite-state steps." This perspective informs the topics we cover in this class (finite-state descriptions of tree languages and tree transformations)
- We explored different CFGs for the language containing all and only those strings with equals numbers of 'a's and 'b's. 
- We introduced informally the notion of Strictly 2-Local grammars and languages (bigram grammars and languages).
- For Friday, read Unit 3 in [Graf's book](graf-book/999_CompleteLectureNotes.pdf)

### Mon 08 Feb 2021

- We finished going over the rewrite grammars handout.
  - We did exercise 4 on the class whiteboard.
  - We talked about how originally formal language theory was based on sets of strings, but two main innovations since then include the study of sets of trees and transformations over strings and trees.
  - We related grammars recognizing infinite sets of strings in computational linguistics to equations defining infinite sets of points in math/physics, etc.
- Read the organizational structure of the paper [Stabler 2019](readings/Stabler-2019-Three-Mathematical-Foundations-for-Syntax.pdf) 
  - What are the section headings of sections 2, 3 and 4?
  - What is the coincidence he refers to?
  - Without reading the details of sections 2, 3, and 4, what is the main thesis of the paper?
- For fun, see if you can write a context free grammar for the language containing all and only those strings with equals numbers of 'a's and 'b's. 


### Fri 05 Feb 2021

- We discussed the paper [Rooij and Baggio 2021](readings/RooijBaggio2021.pdf) 
- We finished the handout on [rewrite grammars](handouts/rewrite-grammars.pdf)
- For Monday:
  - Read Chapter 1 of [Graf's book](graf-book/999_CompleteLectureNotes.pdf). 
  There is a lot in there but focus on the themes of 'computation', the competence/performance distinction, and Marr's levels. 
  The discussion of Turing machines, sorting algorithms and memory addresses are informative, but strictly speaking not necessary for the larger conceptual points.


### Wed 03 Feb 2021

- Today we introduced the course and went over the syllabus.
- We got through the first few pages on [rewrite grammars](handouts/rewrite-grammars.pdf)
- For Friday:
  - Read [Rooij and Baggio 2021](readings/RooijBaggio2021.pdf) 
  - Think about what languages G2 and G3 generate/recognize/accept.
  - Please make sure you have a github account set up and send me your username so I can add you to the "Compling2-Spring2021-SBU" github organization.

### Mon 01 Feb 2021

Classes cancelled due to a winter storm.
