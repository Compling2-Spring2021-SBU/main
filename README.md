## Class Log

### Fri 12 Feb 2021

- We discussed bigram grammars and languages.
- We talked about mathematical notation w.r.t precision and redundancy.
- For Monday, read Unit 4 up to section 2.3 (up to page 64) in [Graf's book](graf-book/999_CompleteLectureNotes.pdf)
- We will talk about SL2 Substitution Closure on Monday.
- Optional Resources: 
  - I added [Jim Rogers' notes on SL](handouts/slocal.ho.pdf)  to the handouts readings.
  - Jim and I also presented a lot of this at ESSLLI in 2014 in minicourse. Here are the [course's slides](http://jeffreyheinz.net/talks/Rogers-Heinz-2014-MTP-ESSLI-slides.pdf)

### Wed 10 Feb 2021

- We discussed the Stabler paper and emphasized the following:
  - Trees are important for syntax and are motivated by different kinds of observations
  - Stabler's position that "Given the importance of tree languages in linguistic theory, they deserve more attention than they receive."
  - Stabler's 3rd summary point: "In some mildly context-sensitive formalizations of recent syntax, the set of derivations is a regular tree language, and the effect of movement is a regular transduction. This reveals that human languages can be defined in two finite-state steps." This perspective informs the topics we cover in this class (finite-state descriptions of tree languages and tree transformations)
- We explored different CFGs for the language containing all and only those strings with equals numbers of 'a's and 'b's. 
- We introduced informally the notion of Strictly 2-Local grammars and languages (bigram grammars and languages).
- For Friday, read Unit 3 in [Graf's book](graf-book/999_CompleteLectureNotes.pdf)

### Mon 08 Feb 2021

- We finished going over the rewrite grammars handout.
  - We did exercise 4 on the class whiteboard.
  - We talked about how originally formal language theory was based on sets of strings, but two main innovations since then include the study of sets of trees and transformations over strings and trees.
  - We related grammars recognizing infinite sets of strings in computational linguistics to equations defining infinite sets of points in math/physics, etc.
- Read the organizational structure of the paper [Stabler 2019](readings/Stabler-2019-Three-Mathematical-Foundations-for-Syntax.pdf) 
  - What are the section headings of sections 2, 3 and 4?
  - What is the coincidence he refers to?
  - Without reading the details of sections 2, 3, and 4, what is the main thesis of the paper?
- For fun, see if you can write a context free grammar for the language containing all and only those strings with equals numbers of 'a's and 'b's. 


### Fri 05 Feb 2021

- We discussed the paper [Rooij and Baggio 2021](readings/RooijBaggio2021.pdf) 
- We finished the handout on [rewrite grammars](handouts/rewrite-grammars.pdf)
- For Monday:
  - Read Chapter 1 of [Graf's book](graf-book/999_CompleteLectureNotes.pdf). 
  There is a lot in there but focus on the themes of 'computation', the competence/performance distinction, and Marr's levels. 
  The discussion of Turing machines, sorting algorithms and memory addresses are informative, but strictly speaking not necessary for the larger conceptual points.


### Wed 03 Feb 2021

- Today we introduced the course and went over the syllabus.
- We got through the first few pages on [rewrite grammars](handouts/rewrite-grammars.pdf)
- For Friday:
  - Read [Rooij and Baggio 2021](readings/RooijBaggio2021.pdf) 
  - Think about what languages G2 and G3 generate/recognize/accept.
  - Please make sure you have a github account set up and send me your username so I can add you to the "Compling2-Spring2021-SBU" github organization.

### Mon 01 Feb 2021
